After use, people pour a mix of ground peanut shells and sugarcane splinters into the dry toilets. Waste is collected and turned into compost.

I thought I was tired of life,\" he recalls. \"When I was in the camp, I was uneasy. Sometimes my things got stolen. I had a lot of problems, but since I came here, I feel very relaxed.\" A program sponsored by the American Red Cross, in partnership with CARE, helped homeowners repair and expand their houses, as well as make them more disaster-resistant. The homeowners who benefit from this program agree to provide a free room to former camp residents for 18 to 24 months, offering them a safe place to live as they continue to rebuild their lives.</p>",

The streetlights can reduce crime, mitigate gender-based violence, facilitate study after dark, and extend the hours during which residents can walk and conduct business in the neighborhood.</p>",
