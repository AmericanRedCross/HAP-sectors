I thought I was tired of life,\" he recalls. \"When I was in the camp, I was uneasy. Sometimes my things got stolen. I worked. I had a lot of problems, but since I came here, I feel very relaxed.\" A program sponsored by the American Red Cross, in partnership with CARE, is helping homeowners repair and expand their houses, as well as making them more disaster-resistant. The homeowners who benefit from this program agree to provide a free room to former camp residents for 18 to 24 months, offering them a safe place to live as they rebuild their lives."
